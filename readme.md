## Project Description

Chrome extension that injects AI generated image descriptions into missing alt attributes for screen readers to read. For the future, the chrome extension would be able to restructure the HTML, through semantic tags and ARIA labels, for better usability.

## Improvement

Since we want to ensure that the descriptions that are being generated are accurately describing the images, we would user test with volunteers who are visually impared and have them tell us whether they believe that the description being generated is detailed enough for their use.

Additionally, we would like to store the alt text that is being generated as a way to train our models. Since we didn't have a lot of time to explore different models, it would be interesting to continue fine tuning to figure out what model works best.

## Constraints

For this projects, we were limited by the tokens for our AI model. After doing massive amounts of testing, we ran out of tokens near the end.

As mentioned previously, we also don't have certainty that the alt text that is being generated is accurate enough for end users, which would require testing.
